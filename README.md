# D-Sight-Learning-Based-Reconstruction
A learning-based approach to do photometric stereo.

We extended the idea of the fast Poisson solver, but instead of using a lookup table or an MLP regressor to predict surface gradients from the (R, G, B) tuple, we employed a U-Net. We pass the raw RGB image through the U-Net to obtain a 2-channel gradient tensor, and then use a fast Poisson solver to reconstruct the height. The supervisory signal is generated by the ground truth value of the height of a calibration ball with a known diameter.
